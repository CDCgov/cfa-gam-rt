Description: An opinionated implementation of a generalized additive
    modeling (GAMs) approach to estimate epidemic dynamics. This flexible
    semi-parametric method allows fitting to arbitrary incidence
    timeseries, with a natural Bayesian interpretation. Underlying
    inference methods are implemented via the `{mgcv}` package, which is
    optimized to produce quick, robust model fits and has well-developed
    diagnostic methods. These methods are employed here with a focus on
    _real-time_ use cases. The package is meant for drop-in use in an
    emerging outbreak, complementing MCMC-based inference methods.
