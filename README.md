## Overview

This project is an in-development R package for $R_t$ estimation using generalized additive models (GAMs).
Over the last few years, GAMs have been used with some success to estimate epidemic growth rates and nowcast cases (see [Ward, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056636) and [Mellor, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-023-00424-4) for an overview of methods).
GAM-based models enable rapid, adaptable prototyping, testing different model structures and data sources with minimal computational and development cost.
The [R package `{mgcv}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html) provides a flexible, fast, and robust interface to fit penalized-spline based models.
However, the substantial research effort into spline-based approaches has not been unified into a shared R package.

This R package aims to become an opinionated re-implementation of the literature methods, with a focus on enabling hierarchical modeling.
Development effort is optimized around real-time use-cases, with potential for right-truncation, noisy reporting, and uncertain data-generating processes.
It is meant to be a simple drop-in tool to be run alongside more computationally intensive implementations like [`{EpiNow2}`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2).

At the moment, the package has some simple functionality to fit a adaptive smooth trend to a single epidemic timeseries and produce a short forecast.
It has not yet been benchmarked relative to other approaches.

## Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github("cdcgov/cfa-gam-rt@v0.1.0")
```

## Use

The package can be used to fit smooth trends of time to noisy epidemic data.
It includes a simulated dataset from Gostic et al., 2020 "Practical considerations for measuring the effective reproductive number, $R_t$".
This snippet uses the simulated dataset to demonstrate how to use the main model-fitting function:

```r
library(RtGam)

fit <- RtGam(
        cases = stochastic_sir_rt[["obs_incidence"]],
        # Randomly chosen date
        reference_date = stochastic_sir_rt[["time"]] + as.Date("2023-01-01")
       )
print(fit)
```
